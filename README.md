## Summary of Me

This repository contains a curated selection of works to showcase my ability as a developer, mathematician, and engineer. My primary language is C#, but you will find that I am also proficient in Python, Java, Javascript, and other programming languages. The majority of my professional experience is in the desktop environment, but I also have a strong understanding of ASP.NET.

My ability to program is fueled by my love for Mathematics. I intend to pursue my Masters of Science in Mathematic Computer Science at UIC. As such, you will likely find a lot more math in this repository than you would in a comparable one created by another software developer. I believe that the inclusion of precise mathematical thinking is highly important at every phase of the software development life cycle and I believe that I bring that to the table everywhere I go.

Besides my love for math and solving problems I also have a great deal of respect for and interest in design patterns. I believe that every programming challenge is either solved or created well before the developer engages with it and the only way to truly develop lasting code, is to develop with consistent and lasting patterns. Hopefully I'll be able to find ways to demonstrate this as time goes on in this repository.
